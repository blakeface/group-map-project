# Whereabouts!

Whereabouts is a community-powered map for overlooked points-of-interests. It captures hidden gems that only a true local would know, giving the user a more authentic experience then what other travel-sites can offer.

Whereabouts was built using Socket.io, Google Maps API, Node.js, Express, PostreSQL (specifically Knex.js), Passport and Passport Local.
